ðŸ“Š Personal Spending Dashboard â€” Streamlit Project Action Plan
1. Project Setup - Done

2. Data Preparation
2.1. Organize Your Raw Data
Place your Excel file (e.g., spending.xlsx) into the project folder.

Assume data structure stays consistent.

3. Develop Streamlit Dashboard
3.1. Create Main Script
Name your main file: dashboard.py

3.2. Dashboard Features & Implementation Steps
a) File Loader
Use Streamlitâ€™s file_uploader to upload or reload your Excel file.

b) Data Parsing
Use pandas.read_excel() to load your file.

Clean or preprocess data if needed (dates, categories, amounts).

c) Sidebar Filters
Add sidebar widgets:

Select year/month (or date range)

Select category

d) KPI Metrics
Show high-level stats:

Total spending

Monthly average

Largest expense category

e) Visualizations
Line chart: Spending over time (by month)

Pie/Bar chart: Breakdown by category

f) Data Table
Display a table of filtered transactions

g) (Optional) Export
Add a download button for filtered data as CSV

4. Run and Test Locally
4.1. Launch Dashboard
sh
Copy
Edit
streamlit run dashboard.py
4.2. Open in Browser
Streamlit automatically launches in your default browser at http://localhost:8501

5. Maintenance & Data Refresh
5.1. Update Data
Replace the Excel file in your project folder whenever you have new spending data.

Re-upload using dashboard, or re-run the app.

5.2. Further Enhancements
Add new chart types or metrics as your analysis needs grow.

Refine filters, add budget tracking, or trend analysis as desired.

6. Example File Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
~/spending_dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.py
â”œâ”€â”€ spending.xlsx
â””â”€â”€ README.md
7. (Optional) Share or Backup
Back up your dashboard.py and Excel files.

If desired, sync your project folder with GitHub (private repo recommended for personal data).

8. Sample Code Snippet (Starter Template)
python
Copy
Edit
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# File uploader
uploaded_file = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Upload your spending Excel file", type=["xlsx"])
if uploaded_file:
    df = pd.read_excel(uploaded_file)
    st.write("Preview:", df.head())

    # Assume columns: Date, Category, Amount
    # Add sidebar filters (customize as needed)
    year = st.sidebar.selectbox("Year", sorted(df['Date'].dt.year.unique()))
    df_filtered = df[df['Date'].dt.year == year]

    # KPIs
    st.metric("Total Spend", f"${df_filtered['Amount'].sum():,.2f}")

    # Visualization examples (add plotly/matplotlib as needed)
    st.line_chart(df_filtered.groupby(df_filtered['Date'].dt.month)['Amount'].sum())
    st.bar_chart(df_filtered.groupby('Category')['Amount'].sum())

    # Show filtered data table
    st.dataframe(df_filtered)
else:
    st.info("Please upload your spending Excel file.")
